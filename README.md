# Social Care Application

## General

![Social Care Application](http://i.imgur.com/80v8RtA.jpg)

This project was done to complete my final year in BSc Computing at Birkbeck. It consists of two parts:

* Android Application
* Web Application

This repository is the code for the Android Application. To look at the web application please click [here](https://github.com/dannymonroy/SocialCarePanel).

## Motivation

After working some years in the social care industry in the United Kingdom I got to see first hand the inefficient use of resources to solve that I started programming this application in the Spring of 2017.

The motivation was to help with the communication deficiencies in the industry.

To do this the system is composed of two parts an Android application and a web application.

## Web Application

The web application is what allows a manager to control the information towards a care worker (via the Android Application) and create, update and keep track of clients and care workers.

To do this, mainly PHP was used for the backend and for the front end and Bootstrap 4 was used for the front end.

All designs were created for this specific information. In terms of reporting Vis.js was used to display graphs.
